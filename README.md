I am a PhD student at the University of Coimbra, Portugal.

**Supervisors: Vasco Mantas (UC/CITEUC) / Courtney Schumacher (Texas A&M University)**

Since my undergraduate studies, I have shown great interest in two aspects: i) numbers, and ii) how space technology through Remote Sensing is able to record information from the earth's surface. Radar remote sensing fanatic! :grimacing:.
